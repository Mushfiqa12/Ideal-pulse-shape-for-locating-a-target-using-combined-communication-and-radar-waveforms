# Ideal-pulse-shape-for-locating-a-target-using-combined-communication-and-radar-waveforms
**AIM:** The aim of this study is to design and analyze an optimal pulse shape that enhances the accuracy of target detection while simultaneously ensuring efficient data transmission in joint radar-communication (JRC) systems. By integrating communication and radar functionalities into a unified waveform, the research seeks to develop a pulse shape that optimally balances key parameters such as range resolution, spectral efficiency, target localization accuracy, and interference mitigation. The ideal pulse should maximize radar detection capabilities by improving range and Doppler resolution while maintaining robust communication performance through efficient spectrum utilization and minimal signal distortion. This study explores various pulse shaping techniques, including windowed and phase-coded waveforms, to identify a waveform that achieves the best trade-off between detection sensitivity and data transmission reliability. Through theoretical analysis and simulation-based evaluations, the research aims to establish a framework for designing waveforms that enhance target detection and localization while fulfilling modern communication demands in integrated radar-communication systems.
